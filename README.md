This project implements a desktop app that acts as a city hallâ€™s document issuing system. There are two types of users, regular and admin.
Each regular user can log into their account, add properties that they own and request documents for them.
The admin can view all the users in the system, all the documents and requests from the regular users, and can also approve/delete the requests and update the document types.
